# Vehicle Telemetry System in Unity

## Background
This project is the implementation of a test task focused on developing a Vehicle Telemetry System using Unity. The assignment comes with a set of prebuilt assets, encompassing various vehicle models, road structures, and the Vehicle Physics Pro (VPP) package. The objective goes beyond just data extraction and management â€” a visually cohesive scene with a foundational road and a working vehicle is to be constructed using these assets. Additionally, the VPP settings are to be tailored to fit one of the available vehicle models.

## Project Requirements:
1. **Time Constraint:** Complete the assignment within 8-10 hours.
2. **Version Control:** Keep consistent commits at every vital development phase.
3. **Initialization:** Use the supplied asset packs and VPP package. Set up a primary road and tweak the VPP for a vehicle model from the assets.
4. **Parameter Extraction:** Design a class or manager to fetch and observe:
    - **Vehicle Velocity**: Current speed in km/h.
    - **Engine Rotations**: RPM for engine performance.
    - **Engine Status**: Check if the engine is on/off.
    - **Active Gear Position**: Current engaged gear.
    - **Transmission Mode**: Whether it's automatic, manual, or semi-automatic.
    - **Proximity to Next Car**: Show the distance to the next car within 20 meters, activated only when the car is in view.
5. **Global Accessibility:** Ensure that the vehicle metrics can be accessed from any part of the codebase.
6. **HUD Integration:** A real-time Heads-Up Display (HUD) should present these metrics during gameplay.

## Evaluation:
1. **Code Structure:** The code should adhere to Rider-style coding conventions and be well-commented.
2. **Functionality:** All required parameters should be accurately extracted and accessible.
3. **Implementation:** Efficiently use Unity-specific optimizations.
4. **Version Control:** Maintain a clear commit history with descriptive messages and manage branching as required.
5. **HUD Display:** The HUD should be user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Assets Utilized:
1. **Roads and Environment:** Sourced from Unity Asset Store.
2. **Vehicles:** Sourced from Unity Asset Store.
3. **Vehicle Physics Pro:** Sourced from Unity Asset Store.

## Note:
Post completion and assessment of this project, there will be further discussions regarding potential collaboration opportunities. This test is a preliminary evaluation of the developer's skills, and an outstanding execution might open doors to more intricate and challenging ventures.

If there are any queries or if you need further details before diving into the project, do not hesitate to ask. 

Wishing you the best of luck!
